# The Wild Oasis

1. "The Wild Oasis" is a small boutique hotel with 8 luxurious wooden cabins

2. They need a custom-built application to manage everything about the hotel:
   **bookings**, **cabins**, and **guests**

3. This is the internal application used inside the hotel to check in guests as
   they arrive

4. They have nothing right now, so they also need the API

5. Later they will probably want a customer-facing website as well, where
   customers will be able to book stays, using the same API
